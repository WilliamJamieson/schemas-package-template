# Cookiecutter template for an ASDF schemas package

This is a [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) template for
a Python package that provides schemas and an extension definition to
the [asdf](https://asdf.readthedocs.io) library.

## Using this template

First install cookiecutter:

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

Then run the following command to create a package from this template:

```
cookiecutter gh:asdf-format/schemas-package-template
```

cookiecutter will ask several questions and then generate
package structure in the chosen directory.  The package may then
be customized with additional schemas and manifest content.
